# S3 Cache Buildkite Plugin

![CI](https://github.com/peakon/s3-cache-buildkite-plugin/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)

Save and restore cache to and from AWS S3.

## Example

Add the following to your `pipeline.yml`:

```yml
steps:
  - command: npm install && npm test
    plugins:
      - peakon/s3-cache#v2.1.3:
          id: CACHE_IDENTIFIER # optional, default: none
          aws_profile: aws-profile-name # optional, default: none
          restore_dry_run: false # set it to "true" to only check if cacheKey is present on S3 (no download / restoring)
          save:
            - key: 'v1-node-modules-{{ checksum("package-lock.json") }}' # required
              paths: [ "node_modules" ] # required, array of strings
              when: on_success # optional, one of {always, on_success, on_failure}, default: on_success
              overwrite: false # optional, set true to overwrite cache on S3 even if object already exists
          restore:
            - keys:
                - 'v1-node-modules-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}'
                - 'v1-node-modules-' # will load latest cache starting with v1-node-modules- (not yet implemented)
```

## Configuration


### Prerequisites

Make sure to set `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_S3_CACHE_BUCKET_NAME=your-cache-bucket-name` before using this plugin.

### Plugin

You can specify either `save` or `restore` or both of them for a single pipeline step.


#### Checking if cache was successfully restored

In some cases you may need to build a conditional logic in the build command based on the results of cache restore operation (for example, to avoid re-generating the cache which already exists and was restored successfully).

To support this use-case, this plugin exports environment variables that can be used during a `command` step. The feature is opt-in and requires `id` to be specified in plugin configuration. 

For example, this step generates a cache of `node_modules` (which is then used by all jobs that need it):

```yml
steps:
  - command: "[ ! \"${BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_S3_CACHE_npm_0_KEY_0_HIT}\" =~ ^(true)$ ] && npm install"
    plugins:
      - peakon/s3-cache:
          id: npm
          restore_dry_run: true # This saves runtime, but doesn't check for integrity 
          restore:
            - keys: [ 'v1-node-modules-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}' ]
          save:
            - key: 'v1-node-modules-{{ checksum "package-lock.json" }}'
              paths: [ "node_modules" ]

```


#### Supported functions

- `checksum 'filename'` - sha256 hash of a `filename`

- `epoch` - time in seconds since Unix epoch (in UTC)

- `.Environment.SOME_VAR` - a value of environment variable `SOME_VAR`


#### AWS profiles

You can specify a custom AWS profile to be used by AWS CLI

- in pipeline YAML (`aws_profile: profile_name`)
- via `BUILDKITE_PLUGIN_S3_CACHE_AWS_PROFILE` environment variable (e.g. inside agent environment hook).
